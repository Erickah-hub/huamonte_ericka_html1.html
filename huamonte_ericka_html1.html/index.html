    <div>
    <p>Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15<sup>th</sup> century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a <i>mystery</i>.</p>
    
    <p>When the explorer <b>Hiram Bingham III</b> encountered Machu Picchu in 1911, he was looking for a different city, known as Vilcabamba. This was a hidden capital to which the Inca had escaped after the Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1532. Over time it became famous as <i>the legendary Lost City of the Inca</i>.</p>
    <p>Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).</p>

        <li>The best time to visit Machu Picchu is between May and September, when the weather is dry.<br/></li>
        <li>Take the train in the morning, spend your day at the site and return that evening.</li>
        <li>If you want to climb one of the nearby mountains or be one of the first at the site, spend a night in Aguas Calientes.</li>
        <li>The train from Cusco takes nearly four hours; from Ollantaytambo, the train takes approximately two hours.</li>
        <li>Climb Huayna Picchu, that iconic pyramid-shaped mountain often captured in Machu Picchu photos.</li>
        <li>A less harrowing (but more physically demanding) route leads around the mountain past the Temple of the Moon, which takes about two to three hours.</li>
